# Developing a Neural Network Classification Model

## AIM
To develop a neural network classification model for the given dataset.

## THEORY
The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples from three species of iris flowers (Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica). Each sample has four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The goal is to build a neural network model that can classify a given iris flower into one of these three species based on the provided features.

## Neural Network Model
Include the neural network model diagram.

## DESIGN STEPS
### STEP 1: Load the dataset
Load the Iris dataset using a suitable library.

### STEP 2: Preprocess the data
Preprocess the data by handling missing values and normalizing features.

### STEP 3: Split the dataset
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

### STEP 4: Train the model
Train a classification model using the training data.

### STEP 5:  Evaluate the model
Evaluate the model on the test data and calculate accuracy.

### STEP 6: Display results
Display the test accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
